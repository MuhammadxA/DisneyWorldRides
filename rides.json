Board a canopied tramp steamer piloted by your trusty skipper, who will expertly navigate you through some of the world’s most treacherous waters.\n\nSteam past lush foliage, butterflies and waterfalls on the Amazon in South America. Glimpse an abandoned camp overrun by curious gorillas on the shores of the African Congo.\n\nWatch for angry hippos, hungry lions and 'sleeping' zebras along the Nile and be on the lookout for a missing Jungle Cruise vessel and its helpless passengers. As the cruise continues down the Mekong River, you just might learn that the jungle always gets the last laugh.\n\nIt’s a 10-minute, 10,000-mile journey that you won't soon forget!", "Park" : "Magic Kingdom", "Land" : "Adventureland"}
